It is designed to work with both small and large projects and assists with speed and efficiency. Git is specifically a distributed revision control system which works hard to increase speed, data integrity and supports non-linear distributed workflows. Git works on Linux, Windows and Mac Systems. Git commands are short, simple and to the point, similar to Unix" </p>

            <p class="lead">"Version Control is a software tool. It allows developers to store of multiple versions (past and present) of their works (such as websites, documents and programs.) It makes it easy to resort back to a simpler model if a newer model has too many bugs or issues. It is also extremely useful for multiple developers to work on a single project. For example, say a new developer takes over for an older one, they can use version control to see past works to get a feel for what the previous developer was working towards."</p>

It is built for free public open-source code, and embodies the sharing programmer environment making a safe environment for new programmers to learn from more experienced. It also makes for a good accessible project portfolio for future employers or coworkers to see past works. GitHub also includes in-line editing, wikis and ticketing for its users. It is one of the most popular and common visual control websites due to it’s simplicity, design and user accessibility. Many companies and schools use it, both big and small, private and corporate."</p>

A set of commit objects, a set of references to commit objects (called heads) are all stored in a git repository.
